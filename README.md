# Guardian Evaluator — by EthicAI Labs  
*Self-Auditing LLM Safety & Alignment Framework*

## Mission
EthicAI Labs aims to build **trustworthy, reflective, and aligned intelligence**.

This project develops a system where AI can:

- Evaluate its own responses
- Detect harmful or biased content
- Identify hallucinations
- Explain its judgement
- Improve through constitutional feedback loops

## Why
As AGI approaches reality, **capability is not enough**.  
We need intelligence that is:

✅ Safe  
✅ Transparent  
✅ Self-critical  
✅ Aligned with human values

## Roadmap
- [ ] Basic safety scoring agent
- [ ] Constitutional rule engine (C-AI inspired)
- [ ] Multi-LLM judge system
- [ ] Safety benchmark dataset
- [ ] Research preprint & demo release

## Philosophy
> The future belongs not to the most powerful intelligence,  
> but the most **ethical and self-reflective** one.
